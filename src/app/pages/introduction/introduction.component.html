            Hey, I'm Mat, and welcome to RetroSki!
        </div>

    <div class="retro-text">
        I've always been fascinated by games that are
        <strong>easy to learn but hard to master</strong>.
    </div>
    <div class="retro-text">
        That's exactly what RetroSki is all about: a <strong>simple</strong> yet
        <strong>skill-based retro 2D skiing game</strong> that lets you enjoy
        the ride while constantly improving.
    </div>
    <div class="retro-text">
        The slopes are <strong>randomly generated</strong>, designed to match
        one of <strong>four alpine skiing disciplines</strong>, so every run is
        different.
    </div>
    <div class="retro-text">
        Whether you're practicing your slalom turns or flying down the downhill
        course, <strong>there's always something new to explore</strong>.

    <app-expander title="Where it all started ?">
        <div class="retro-text">
            Back in <strong>January 2024</strong>, I was looking for a game to
            play with my girlfriend. Something simple, fun, and fair, where we
            could both start on equal footing.
        </div>
        <div class="retro-text">
            Turns out, that wasn't so easy to find. So,
            <strong>I decided to make one myself</strong>.
        </div>
        <div class="retro-text">
            Maybe not my best idea... Developing the game gave me a bit of a
            head start. <strong>But don't be fooled</strong>, Emi has become a
            fierce competitor. <strong>Watch out!</strong>

    <app-expander title="A game without ads">
        <div class="retro-text">
            From the start, I wanted <strong>RetroSki</strong> to be a game you
            could enjoy <strong>without interruptions</strong>.
            <strong>No pop-ups</strong>, <strong>no forced ads</strong>,
            <strong>just pure gameplay</strong>.
        </div>
        <div class="retro-text">
            At the same time, I also wanted the game to be
            <strong>fully accessible for free</strong>, so anyone could pick it
            up and have fun.
        </div>
        <div class="retro-text">
            To keep things fair, RetroSki offers optional
            <strong>premium memberships</strong>, which lets you create
            <strong>your own private servers</strong> to race with friends.
        </div>
        <div class="retro-text">
            But whether you're a free rider or a premium one,
            <strong>the core experience stays the same</strong>: just you, the
            slopes, and the thrill of the ride.
